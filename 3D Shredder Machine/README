  This 3D Printed Shredder Machine is used by rotating a crank to generate a rotational movement of 2 gears that shred the items the user puts inside a recipient.
  The shredded items are then eliminated through the bottom of the mechanism.
    Project status:
      1st checkpoint: Added the first conceptual version on github and named some components.
      2nd checkpoint: Designed the base and the lower part of the container.
