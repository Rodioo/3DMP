  This 3D Printed Shredder Machine is used by rotating a crank to generate a rotational movement of 2 gears that shred the items the user puts inside a recipient.
  The shredded items are then eliminated through the bottom of the mechanism.
    Project status:
      1st checkpoint: Added the first conceptual version on github and named some components.
      2nd checkpoint: Designed the base and the lower part of the container.
      3rd checkpoint: Finished the upper container and the recipient.
      4th checkpoint: Finished the joints, motion studies and the appeareance. (FINAL VERSION)
      
  
  Components and Joints:
      Components:
            - Base : supports the entire mechanism.
            - Lower container : lower part of the container where the shredder gears will go.
            - Upper container : upper part of the container where the shredder gears will go.
            - 2 x Shredders : shredder gears that rotate and destroy the items inserted in the mechanism.
            - Recipient : the recipient where the items that will be shredded are inserted.
            - Crank : the part that produces the shredding action.
            - Trash container : a small container that collects the shredded trash.
       
       Joints:
            - 2 x revolute for the 2 shredder gears.
            - revolute for the crank 
            - motion link that connects the 2 revolute gears together.
            - motion link that connects the crank revolute to the gear revolute.
            - slider for the removal of the trash container.
            
   
   Motion studies:
        - Rotating the crank and the shredders to show the mechanism in action.
        - Trash container removal to see how the container is removed.
